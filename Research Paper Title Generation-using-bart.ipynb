However, currently mostsimulation models for investigating service systems are still built in the sameway as manufacturing simulation models, using a process-oriented world view,i.e. they model the flow of passive entities through a system. These kinds ofmodels allow studying aspects of operational management but are not well suitedfor studying the dynamics that appear in service systems due to humanbehaviour. For these kinds of studies we require tools that allow modelling thesystem and entities using an object-oriented world view, where intelligentobjects serve as abstract \"actors\" that are goal directed and can behaveproactively. In our work we combine process-oriented discrete event simulationmodelling and object-oriented agent based simulation modelling to investigatethe impact of people management practices on retail productivity. In thispaper, we reveal in a series of experiments what impact considering proactivitycan have on the output accuracy of simulation models of human centric systems.The model and data we use for this investigation are based on a case study in aUK department store. We show that considering proactivity positively influencesthe validity of these kinds of models and therefore allows analysts to makebetter recommendations regarding strategies to apply people managementpractises.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: An Efficient Encryption Algorithm for P2P Networks Robust Against\n","  Man-in-the-Middle Adversary\n","\n","Predicted Title: -key Cryptosystem for Peer-to-Peer Networks\n","\n","Abstract:   Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular as a new paradigm forinformation exchange and are being used in many applications such as filesharing, distributed computing, video conference, VoIP, radio and TVbroadcasting. This popularity comes with security implications andvulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Especially duo to directcommunication between two end nodes in P2P networks, these networks arepotentially vulnerable to \"Man-in-the-Middle\" attacks. In this paper, wepropose a new public-key cryptosystem for P2P networks that is robust againstMan-in-the-Middle adversary. This cryptosystem is based on RSA and knapsackproblems. Our precoding-based algorithm uses knapsack problem for performingpermutation and padding random data to the message. We show that comparing toother proposed cryptosystems, our algorithm is more efficient and it is fullysecure against an active adversary.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: PCA-Based Relevance Feedback in Document Image Retrieval\n","\n","Predicted Title: levance Feedback for Document Image Retrieval System\n","\n","Abstract:   Research has been devoted in the past few years to relevance feedback as aneffective solution to improve performance of information retrieval systems.Relevance feedback refers to an interactive process that helps to improve theretrieval performance. In this paper we propose the use of relevance feedbackto improve document image retrieval System (DIRS) performance. This papercompares a variety of strategies for positive and negative feedback. Inaddition, feature subspace is extracted and updated during the feedback processusing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and based on user'sfeedback. That is, in addition to reducing the dimensionality of featurespaces, a proper subspace for each type of features is obtained in the feedbackprocess to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that usingrelevance Feedback in DIR achieves better performance than common DIR.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Evidence of Open Access of scientific publications in Google Scholar: a\n","  large-scale analysis\n","\n","Predicted Title: igating Open Access Levels Across Countries and\n","  Fields of Research\n","\n","Abstract:   This article uses Google Scholar (GS) as a source of data to analyse OpenAccess (OA) levels across all countries and fields of research.

Thisallowed us to distinguish the percentage of documents in our sample that aremade OA by the publisher (23.1%, including Gold, Hybrid, Delayed, and BronzeOA) from those available as Green OA (17.6%), and those available from othersources (40.6%, mainly due to ResearchGate). The data shows an overall freeavailability of 54.6%, with important differences at the country and subjectcategory levels. The data extracted from GS yielded very similar results tothose found by other studies that analysed similar samples of documents, butemployed different methods to find evidence of OA, thus suggesting a relativeconsistency among methods.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Internal controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation on a bounded\n","  domain\n","\n","Predicted Title: ability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with distributed control\n","\n","Abstract:   This paper is concerned with the control properties of the Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equation posed on a bounded interval with a distributed control.

In this pursuit, we explore the tradeoffs between these tworouting strategies with respect to hop count, number of edges and lifetime permulticast tree with respect to the Random Waypoint, City Section and Manhattanmobility models. We employ the Breadth First Search algorithm and the MinimumSteiner Tree heuristic for determining a sequence of minimum hop and minimumedge trees respectively. While both the minimum hop and minimum edge treesexist for a relatively longer time under the Manhattan mobility model; thenumber of edges per tree and the hop count per source-receiver path arerelatively low under the Random Waypoint model. For all the three mobilitymodels, the minimum edge trees have a longer lifetime compared to the minimumhop trees and the difference in lifetime increases with increase in networkdensity and/or the multicast group size.

Part one comprises an overviewof currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used forforest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two maincategories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detectionand time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2asatellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become themost promising but also most demanding category of degradation mappingapproaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. Themethods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. Aseparate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studiesfor two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus onEurope and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: Thereview revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forestdegradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transferthese approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors.Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance typesand the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real timedisturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Additive Deformations of Braided Hopf Algebras\n","\n","Predicted Title: -structures and additive deformations of bialgebras\n","\n","Abstract:   Additive deformations of bialgebras in the sense of J.

We will quantize EG by appeal to the most general quantizationapproach, the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle, which is moreappropriate and rigorous that the functional integral method, when we are inthe presence of derivative couplings \\nd We base our efforts on works by SurajN. Gupta and Richard P. Feynman so as to undertake the construction of aQuantum Field Theory (QFT) of Einstein Gravity (EG). We explicitly use theEinstein Lagrangian elaborated by Gupta \\cite{g1} but choose a new constraintfor the theory that differs from Gupta's one. In this way, we avoid the problemof lack of unitarity for the $S$ matrix that afflicts the procedures of Guptaand Feynman. Simultaneously, we significantly simplify the handling ofconstraints. This eliminates the need to appeal to ghosts for guarantying theunitarity of the theory. Our ensuing approach is obviously non-renormalizable.However, this inconvenience can be overcome by appealing tho the mathematicaltheory developed by Bollini et al. \\cite{tp3,tp18,tp19,tp20,pr} Suchdevelopments were founded in the works of Alexander Grothendieck \\cite{gro} andin the theory of Ultradistributions of Jose Sebastiao e Silva \\cite{tp6} (alsoknown as Ultrahyperfunctions). Based on these works, we have constructed amathematical edifice, in a lapse of about 25 years, that is able to quantizenon-renormalizable Field Theories (FT). Here we specialize this mathematicaltheory to treat the quantum field theory of Einsteins's gravity (EG). Becausewe are using a Gupta-Feynman inspired EG Lagrangian, we are able to evade theintricacies of Yang-Mills theories.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Exploring singlet deflection of gauge mediation\n","\n","Predicted Title: -b_mu Gauge Mediation of Supersymmetry Breaking\n","\n","Abstract:   We embed the Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model into gaugemediation of supersymmetry breaking and study the phenomenology of scenarioswhere the gauge-mediation contributions to soft parameters are deflected bysuperpotential interactions of the gauge singlet with the messenger fields andthe Higgs doublets.

Because of theshort cooling time of the gamma-ray emitting electrons, the gamma-ray emissionzone is in the immediate vicinity of the acceleration site. The particleacceleration likely occurs at the termination shock of the relativistic stripedwind, where multiple forced magnetic field reconnections provide strongmagnetic fluctuations facilitating Fermi acceleration processes. Theacceleration mechanisms imply the presence of stochastic magnetic fields in theparticle acceleration region, which cause stochastic variability of thesynchrotron emission. This variability is particularly strong in the steepgamma-ray tail of the spectrum, where modest fluctuations of the magnetic fieldlead to strong flares of spectral flux. In particular, stochastic variations ofmagnetic field, which may lead to quasi-cyclic gamma-ray flares, can beproduced by the relativistic cyclotron ion instability at the terminationshock. Our model calculations of the spectral and temporal evolution ofsynchrotron emission in the spectral cut-off regime demonstrate that theintermittent magnetic field concentrations dominate the gamma-ray emission fromhighest energy electrons and provide fast, strong variability even for aquasi-steady distribution of radiating particles. The simulated light curvesand spectra can explain the very strong gamma-ray flares observed in the Crabnebula and the lack of strong variations at other wavelengths. The modelpredicts high polarization in the flare phase, which can be tested with futurepolarimetry observations.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Kremer-Grest models for commodity polymer melts: Linking theory,\n","  experiment and simulation at the Kuhn scale\n","\n","Predicted Title:  Adaptation of the Kremer-Grest Polymer Model to Model Melt\n","\n","Abstract:   The Kremer-Grest (KG) polymer model is a standard model for studying genericpolymer properties in Molecular Dynamics simulations.

In particular, we provide mapping relations from KG to SIunits for a wide range of commodity polymers. The connection between theexperimental and the KG melts is made at the Kuhn scale, i.e. at the crossoverfrom chemistry-specific small scale to the universal large scale behavior.

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted toimprove the mention-pair model, one by acquiring the mention-ranking model torank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training theentity-mention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferentwith a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreferenceresolution, which combines the strengths of the mention-ranking model and theentity-mention model, and is therefore theoretically more appealing than bothof these models.

Since that time we have found that theformer are related to \"impulsive\" SEP events from impulsive flares or jets.Here, resonant stochastic acceleration, related to magnetic reconnectioninvolving open field lines, produces not only electrons but 1000-foldenhancements of 3He/4He and of (Z>50)/O. Alternatively, in \"gradual\" SEPevents, shock waves, driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs),more democratically sample ion abundances that are even used to measure thecoronal abundances of the elements. Sometimes residual impulsive suprathermalions contribute to the seed population for shock acceleration, complicating theabundance picture, but this process has now been modeled theoretically.Initially, impulsive events define a point source on the Sun, selectivelyfilling few magnetic flux tubes, while gradual events show broad accelerationthat can fill half of the inner heliosphere, beginning when the shock reaches~2 solar radii. Shock acceleration occurs as ions are scattered back and forthacross the shock by resonant Alfven waves amplified by the accelerated protonsthemselves. These waves also can produce a streaming-limited maximum SEPintensity and plateau region upstream of the shock. Behind the shock lies thelarge expanse of the \"reservoir\", a spatially extensive trapped volume ofuniform SEP intensities with invariant energy-spectral shapes where overallintensities decrease with time as the enclosing \"magnetic bottle\" expandsadiabatically. These reservoirs now explain the slow intensity decrease thatdefines gradual events, once erroneously attributed solely to slow outwarddiffusion.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Supercuspidal ramifications and traces of adjoint lifts at good primes\n","\n","Predicted Title: uer classes of the endomorphismalgebras of motives attached to\n","  primitive Hecke eigenforms\n","\n","Abstract:   In this paper, we write down the local Brauer classes of the endomorphismalgebras of motives attached to non-CM primitive Hecke eigenforms for allsupercuspidal primes in terms of traces of adjoint lifts at auxiliary primes.

Predictive maintenance involves usingconcepts of data mining, statistics, and machine learning to build models thatare capable of performing early fault detection, diagnosing the faults andpredicting the time to failure. Fault diagnosis has been one of the core areaswhere the actual failure mode of the machine is identified. In fluctuatingenvironments such as manufacturing, clustering techniques have proved to bemore reliable compared to supervised learning methods. One of the fundamentalchallenges of clustering is developing a test hypothesis and choosing anappropriate statistical test for hypothesis testing.

Ittherefore allows for a direct comparison of measurements (from galaxies inredshift space) to predictions (for matter in real space). In this paper wefirst extend the applicability of such properties of the clustering ratio tocosmologies that include massive neutrinos, by performing tests againstsimulated data. We then investigate the constraining power of the clusteringratio when cosmological parameters such as the total neutrino mass and theequation of state of dark energy are left free. We analyse the joint posteriordistribution of the parameters that must satisfy, at the same time, themeasurements of the galaxy clustering ratio in the SDSS DR12, and the angularpower spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB measuredby the Planck satellite. We find the clustering ratio to be very sensitive tothe CDM density parameter, but not very much so to the total neutrino mass.Lastly, we forecast the constraining power the clustering ratio will achievewith forthcoming surveys, predicting the amplitude of its errors in aEuclid-like galaxy survey. In this case, we find it is expected to improve theconstraint at 95% level on the CDM density by 40% and on the total neutrinomass by 14%.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: New analytic solution for the heat flow through a general harmonic\n","  network\n","\n","Predicted Title: olution of the heat current in a harmonic network coupled with\n","  Ohmic reservoirs\n","\n","Abstract:   We present a new analytic expression for the heat current through a generalharmonic network coupled with Ohmic reservoirs.

Our method does not rely in the usual assumptions of weakcoupling to the environments or on the existence of an infinite cutoff in theenvironmental spectral densities. We use this method to study non-equilibriumprocesses without the weak coupling and Markovian approximations.

Therate of this process is suggested to be controlled by <c+a> pyramidalcross-slip and <a> basal junction formation.

We classify our galaxies into single exponential (TI),down-bending (TII) and up-bending (TIII) SBP types, and derive their spinparameters and radial profiles of age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features.Most TII (TIII) galaxies have down-bending (up-bending) star formation rate(SFR) radial profiles, implying that abrupt radial changes of SFR intensitiescontribute to the formation of both TII and TIII breaks. Nevertheless, acomparison between our galaxies and simulations suggests that stellar migrationplays a significant role in weakening down-bending $\\Sigma_{\\star}$ profilebreaks. While there is a correlation between the break strengths of SBPs andage/metallicity-sensitive spectral features for TII galaxies, no suchcorrelation is found for TIII galaxies, indicating that stellar migration maynot play a major role in shaping TIII breaks, as is evidenced by a goodcorrespondence between break strengths of $\\Sigma_{\\star}$ and surfacebrightness profiles of TIII galaxies. We do not find evidence for galaxy spinbeing a relevant parameter for forming different SBP types, nor do we findsignificant differences between the asymmetries of galaxies with different SBPtypes, suggesting that environmental disturbances or satellite accretion in therecent past do not significantly influence the break formation. By dividing oursample into early and late morphological types, we find that galaxies withdifferent SBP types follow nearly the same tight stellar mass-$R_{25}$relation, which makes the hypothesis that stellar migration alone can transformSBP types from TII to TI and then to TIII highly unlikely.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Supersonic Relative Velocity Effect on the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation\n","  Measurements\n","\n","Predicted Title: bing the effect of supersonic relative velocities on baryonic acoustic\n","  oscillation measurements\n","\n","Abstract:   We investigate the effect of supersonic relative velocities between baryonsand dark matter, recently shown to arise generically at high redshift, onbaryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at low redshift.

We find that if unaccounted, therelative velocity effect can shift the BAO peak position and bias estimates ofthe dark energy equation-of-state due to its non-smooth, out-of-phaseoscillation structure around the BAO scale. Fortunately, the relative velocityeffect can be easily modeled in constraining cosmological parameters withoutsubstantially inflating the error budget.

Taking into consideration many issues, MUs should be able todecide whether to offload their traffic to a complementary wireless LAN. Ourprevious work studied single-flow wireless LAN offloading from a MU'sperspective by considering delay-tolerance of traffic, monetary cost and energyconsumption. In this paper, we study the multi-flow mobile data offloadingproblem from a MU's perspective in which a MU has multiple applications todownload data simultaneously from remote servers, and different applications'data have different deadlines. We formulate the wireless LAN offloading problemas a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) and establishan optimal policy by a dynamic programming based algorithm. Since the timecomplexity of the dynamic programming based offloading algorithm is still high,we propose a low time complexity heuristic offloading algorithm withperformance sacrifice.

In this work, we address dynamic spectrum management mechanisms forLSA systems. We propose a fair spectrum management algorithm for distributingincumbent's available spectrum among mobile networks. Then, we adapt theproposed algorithm to take mobile network operator's regulatory complianceaspect into account and penalize the misbehaving network operators in spectrumallocation. We extend our results to the scenario where more than one incumbentoffer spectrum to the mobile operators in a service area and propose variousprotocols, which ensure long term fair spectrum allocation within theindividual LSA networks. Finally, we numerically evaluate the performance ofthe proposed spectrum allocation algorithms and compare them using variousperformance metrics. For the single incumbent case, the numerical results showthat the spectrum allocation is fair when the mobile operators follow thespectrum access regulations. We demonstrate the effect of our proposed penaltyfunctions on spectrum allocation when the operators do not comply with theregulatory aspects.

While face images aretypically represented as vectors in Euclidean space, characterizing face videoswith some robust set modeling techniques (e.g. covariance matrices as exploitedin this study, which reside on Riemannian manifold), has recently shownappealing advantages. This hence results in a thorny heterogeneous spacesmatching problem. Moreover, hashing with handcrafted features as done in manyexisting works is clearly inadequate to achieve desirable performance for thistask. To address such problems, we present an end-to-end Deep HeterogeneousHashing (DHH) method that integrates three stages including image featurelearning, video modeling, and heterogeneous hashing in a single framework, tolearn unified binary codes for both face images and videos. To tackle the keychallenge of hashing on the manifold, a well-studied Riemannian kernel mappingis employed to project data (i.e. covariance matrices) into Euclidean space andthus enables to embed the two heterogeneous representations into a commonHamming space, where both intra-space discriminability and inter-spacecompatibility are considered. To perform network optimization, the gradient ofthe kernel mapping is innovatively derived via structured matrixbackpropagation in a theoretically principled way.

The High Level Trigger (HLT) is acompute cluster, which reconstructs collisions as recorded by the ALICEdetector in real-time. It employs a custom online data-transport framework todistribute data and workload among the compute nodes.  ALICE employs subdetectors sensitive to environmental conditions such aspressure and temperature, e.g. the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). A precisereconstruction of particle trajectories requires the calibration of thesedetectors. Performing the calibration in real time in the HLT improves theonline reconstructions and renders certain offline calibration steps obsoletespeeding up offline physics analysis. For LHC Run 3, starting in 2020 when datareduction will rely on reconstructed data, online calibration becomes anecessity. Reconstructed particle trajectories build the basis for thecalibration making a fast online-tracking mandatory. The main detectors usedfor this purpose are the TPC and ITS (Inner Tracking System). Reconstructingthe trajectories in the TPC is the most compute-intense step.  We present several improvements to the ALICE High Level Trigger developed tofacilitate online calibration. The main new development for online calibrationis a wrapper that can run ALICE offline analysis and calibration tasks insidethe HLT. On top of that, we have added asynchronous processing capabilities tosupport long-running calibration tasks in the HLT framework, which runsevent-synchronously otherwise. In order to improve the resiliency, an isolatedprocess performs the asynchronous operations such that even a fatal error doesnot disturb data taking. We have complemented the original loop-free HLT chainwith ZeroMQ data-transfer components.

Our studyshows that GBF has several theoretical properties that enable MRE toautomatically identify the most relevant target variables in forming itsexplanation.

However, mostcameras observe only a very small fraction of this distribution. This offersthe possibility of achieving more efficient inference by specializing compact,low-cost models to the specific distribution of frames observed by a singlecamera. In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation(supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher)to specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target videostream.

This is due to the fact that existing methods require to evaluate theproximity operator for the nonsmooth terms, which can be a costly operation forcomplex penalties. In this work we introduce two variance-reduced incrementalmethods based on SAGA and SVRG that can efficiently take into account complexpenalties which can be expressed as a sum of proximal terms. This includespenalties such as total variation, group lasso with overlap and trendfiltering, to name a few. Furthermore, we also develop sparse variants of theproposed algorithms which can take advantage of sparsity in the input data.Like other incremental methods, it only requires to evaluate the gradient of asingle sample per iteration, and so is ideally suited for large scaleapplications. We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methodsand show that they converge with a fixed step-size, achieving in some cases thesame asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants. Empirical benchmarks on 3different datasets illustrate the practical advantages of the proposed methods.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: A Survey Report on Operating Systems for Tiny Networked Sensors\n","\n","Predicted Title:  Review of Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey\n","\n","Abstract:   Wireless sensor network (WSN) has attracted researchers worldwide to explorethe research opportunities, with application mainly in health monitoring,industry automation, battlefields, home automation and environmentalmonitoring.

In this paper we adapt this idea to classical, non-stochasticdomains with partial information and sensing actions, presenting a new planner:SDR (Sample, Determinize, Replan). At each step we generate a solution plan toa classical planning problem induced by the original problem. We execute thisplan as long as it is safe to do so. When this is no longer the case, wereplan. The classical planning problem we generate is based on thetranslation-based approach for conformant planning introduced by Palacios andGeffner. The state of the classical planning problem generated in this approachcaptures the belief state of the agent in the original problem. Unfortunately,when this method is applied to planning problems with sensing, it yields anon-deterministic planning problem that is typically very large. Our maincontribution is the introduction of state sampling techniques for overcomingthese two problems. In addition, we introduce a novel, lazy, regression-basedmethod for querying the agents belief state during run-time. We provide acomprehensive experimental evaluation of the planner, showing that it scalesbetter than the state-of-the-art CLG planner on existing benchmark problems,but also highlighting its weaknesses with new domains.

The first step consists in the creation of ahierarchy of possible parts that can be tightly packed within their minimumbounding boxes. In a second step, the hierarchy is exploited to extract the(single) segmentation whose parts can be most tightly packed. The fact thatshape packing is an NP-complete problem justifies the use of heuristics andapproximated solutions whose efficacy and efficiency must be assessed.Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our algorithm produces satisfactoryresults for arbitrarily-shaped objects while being comparable to ad-hoc methodswhen specific shapes are considered.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: Simultaneous Translation with Flexible Policy via Restricted Imitation\n","  Learning\n","\n","Predicted Title: lexible Policies for Chinese and English Simultaneous Translation\n","\n","Abstract:   Simultaneous translation is widely useful but remains one of the mostdifficult tasks in NLP.

While face images aretypically represented as vectors in Euclidean space, characterizing face videoswith some robust set modeling techniques (e.g. covariance matrices as exploitedin this study, which reside on Riemannian manifold), has recently shownappealing advantages. This hence results in a thorny heterogeneous spacesmatching problem. Moreover, hashing with handcrafted features as done in manyexisting works is clearly inadequate to achieve desirable performance for thistask. To address such problems, we present an end-to-end Deep HeterogeneousHashing (DHH) method that integrates three stages including image featurelearning, video modeling, and heterogeneous hashing in a single framework, tolearn unified binary codes for both face images and videos. To tackle the keychallenge of hashing on the manifold, a well-studied Riemannian kernel mappingis employed to project data (i.e. covariance matrices) into Euclidean space andthus enables to embed the two heterogeneous representations into a commonHamming space, where both intra-space discriminability and inter-spacecompatibility are considered. To perform network optimization, the gradient ofthe kernel mapping is innovatively derived via structured matrixbackpropagation in a theoretically principled way. Experiments on threechallenging datasets show that our method achieves quite competitiveperformance compared with existing hashing methods.\n","\n","\n","\n","True Title: $TeV$-Scale Resonant Leptogenesis with New Scaling Ansatz on Neutrino\n","  Dirac Mass Matrix from $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry\n","\n","Predicted Title: straining the parameter space of the neutrino Dirac mass matrix from\n","  type-I seesaw mechanism\n","\n","Abstract:   We propose a new scaling ansatz in the neutrino Dirac mass matrix to explainthe low energy neutrino oscillations data, baryon number asymmetry andneutrinoless double beta decay. In this work, a full reconstruction of theneutrino Dirac mass matrix has been realized from the low energy neutrinooscillations data based on type-I seesaw mechanism. A concrete model based on$A_4$ flavor symmetry has been considered to generate such a neutrino Diracmass matrix and imposes a relation between the two scaling factors. In thismodel, the right-handed Heavy Majorana neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate atTeV mass scales. Extensive numerical analysis studies have been carried out toconstrain the parameter space of the model from the low energy neutrinooscillations data. It has been found that the parameter space of the Dirac massmatrix elements lies near or below the MeV region and the scaling factor$|\\kappa_1|$ has to be less than 10. Furthermore, we have examined thepossibility for simultaneous explanation of both neutrino oscillations data andthe observed baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. Such an analysis givesfurther restrictions on the parameter space of the model, thereby explainingthe correct neutrino data as well as the baryon number asymmetry via a resonantleptogenesis scenario.

Purpose: We determine the influence of finite-range and separable pairinginteractions on monopole strength functions in semi-magic nuclei.  Methods: We employ self-consistently the Quasiparticle Random PhaseApproximation on top of spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov solutions.

This simple picturehas, however, several drawbacks. There can be very young clusters exhibitingradial patterns maybe reflecting the early effect of gravity on primordial gas.There can be also very evolved cluster showing fractal patterns that eitherhave survived through time or have been generated subsequently by some(unknown) mechanism.

Due to the strong stellarirradiation, radiative region develops on top of the convective region.Internal gravity waves are launched at the radiative-convective boundaries(RCBs). The thermal response is dynamical and plays an important role in theangular momentum transport. By separating the gravitational and thermal forcingterms, we identify the thermal effects for increasing the angular momentumtransport. For the low frequency (in the co-rotating frame with planets)prograde (retrograde) tidal frequency, the angular momentum flux is positive(negative). The tidal interactions tends to drive the planet to the synchronousstate. We find that the angular momentum transport associated with the internalgravity wave is very sensitive to relative position between the RCB and thepenetration depth of the thermal forcing. If the RCB is in the vicinity of thethermal forcing penetration depth, even with small amplitude thermal forcing,the thermally driven angular momentum flux could be much larger than the fluxinduced by gravitational forcing.

1:   We numerically solved the boundary-value problem for Tamm waves (which mayalso be classified as Uller-Zenneck waves here) guided by the planar interfaceof a homogeneous isotropic dissipative dielectric (HIDD) material and aperiodically multilayered isotropic dielectric material. The HIDD material waschosen to be VO${}_2$ which, at optical wavelengths, has atemperature-dependent refractive index with a hysteresis feature, i.e., thetemperature-dependence of its refractive index varies depending upon whetherthe temperature is increasing or decreasing. A numerical code was implementedto extract solutions of the dispersion equation at a fixed wavelength for both$p$- and $s$-polarization states over the temperature range [50,80] degrees. Amultitude of Tamm waves of both linear polarization states were found,demonstrating a clear demarcation of the heating and cooling phases in terms ofwavenumbers and propagation distances. Thereby, the signatures of thermalhysteresis in Tamm-wave propagation were revealed.\n","\n","True Title 1: Signatures of thermal hysteresis in Tamm-wave propagation\n","\n","Predicted Title 1: ation of the boundary-value problem for Tamm waves guided by a\n","  homogeneous isotropic dissipative dielectric material\n","\n","\n","Abstract 2:   We address the problem of person re-identification (reID), that is,retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of theperson of interest. A key challenge is to learn person representations robustto intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute andthe same person's appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. RecentreID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only aparticular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which requirescorresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle thisproblem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated featuresfrom person images. Identity-related features contain information useful forspecifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated oneshold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introducea new generative adversarial network, dubbed \\emph{identity shuffle GAN}(IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels withoutany auxiliary information. We also propose an identity-shuffling technique toregularize the disentangled features. Experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of IS-GAN, significantly outperforming the state of the art onstandard reID benchmarks including the Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID.Our code and models are available online:https://cvlab-yonsei.github.io/projects/ISGAN/.\n","\n","True Title 2: Learning Disentangled Representation for Robust Person Re-identification\n","\n","Predicted Title 2: GAN: Identification Shuffling for Person Re-identification\n","\n","\n","Abstract 3:   In the present paper, an exact mathematical solution has been obtained fornonlinear free transverse vibration of beams, for the first time.

A mathematical explanation is obtained for nonlinear modeshapes as well as natural frequencies versus geometrical and materialproperties of beam. It is shown that as the th mode of transverse vibrationexcited, the mode 2 th of in-plane vibration will be developed. The result ofpresent work is compared with those obtained from Galerkin method and theobserved agreement confirms the exact mathematical solution. It is shown thatthe governing equation is linear in the time domain.

Ammari et al., A high-frequency homogenization approach near the Diracpoints in bubbly honeycomb crystals, arXiv:1812.06178], near the Dirac points,honeycomb crystals of subwavelength resonators has a great potential to be usedas near-zero materials. Here, we perform the analysis for the example of bubblycrystals, which is a classic example of subwavelength resonance, where theresonant frequency of a single bubble is known as the Minnaert resonantfrequency. Our first result is an asymptotic formula for the quasi-periodicMinnaert resonant frequencies. We then prove the linear dispersion relation ofa Dirac cone.

To determine the reason behind the sluggishgrowth of online retailing in the KSA, a mixed methods study involvingretailers and customers was conducted in four stages. The outcomes of the studypoint to distrust in the online retailing environment in Saudi Arabia as a keyinhibitory factor for growth. As such, a five-part model is proposed to promotetrust in the online shopping environment in the KSA.\n","\n","True Title 6: A Conceptual Framework for the Promotion of Trusted Online Retailing\n","  Environment in Saudi Arabia\n","\n","Predicted Title 6: igating Trust in the Online Retailing Environment in the Kingdom of\n","  Saudi Arabia\n","\n","\n","Abstract 7:   Despite the rise to fame of incremental variance-reduced methods in recentyears, their use in nonsmooth optimization is still limited to few simplecases. This is due to the fact that existing methods require to evaluate theproximity operator for the nonsmooth terms, which can be a costly operation forcomplex penalties. In this work we introduce two variance-reduced incrementalmethods based on SAGA and SVRG that can efficiently take into account complexpenalties which can be expressed as a sum of proximal terms. This includespenalties such as total variation, group lasso with overlap and trendfiltering, to name a few. Furthermore, we also develop sparse variants of theproposed algorithms which can take advantage of sparsity in the input data.Like other incremental methods, it only requires to evaluate the gradient of asingle sample per iteration, and so is ideally suited for large scaleapplications. We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methodsand show that they converge with a fixed step-size, achieving in some cases thesame asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants. Empirical benchmarks on 3different datasets illustrate the practical advantages of the proposed methods.\n","\n","True Title 7: Proximal Splitting Meets Variance Reduction\n","\n","Predicted Title 7: fficient Variance-Reduced Incremental Methods for nonsmooth Optimization\n","\n","\n","Abstract 8:   This paper presents a low-cost system architecture that has been proposed forautomatically monitoring air quality indoors and continuously in real-time.
